## DOCKER

A convenient way to run machine learning codes on multiple platforms using Docker. This repository is a ready-to-run `Docker` image which is built on top of `Python` as the main programming language, and `Jupyter Notebook` as the interactive computing tool.

**GitHub Actions** build and push this image to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/). Every update is available at [abmhamdi/mlpy](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abmhamdi/mlpy)
